## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
choco <- read.csv("https://xdaiisu.github.io/ds202materials/hwlabs/choco.csv")
library(ggplot2)
head(choco)
str(choco)
```
```{r}
ggplot(choco, aes(x = Rating)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1) +
  ggtitle("binwidth = 1")
```
This histogram shows that majority of the ratings fall around 3 but there are some rated 1 to 2 and 4.5 to 5 which may be considered an outliers.

```{r}
ggplot(choco, aes(x=Rating, y=Cocoa.Pct)) + geom_point(shape=16, size=3) + theme_bw()
```
It does not appear that ratings depend on the cocoa percentage because they are a wide range of percentages of cocoa for each rating and it seems similarly spread.
